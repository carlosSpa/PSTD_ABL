FOLDERS: the folder "Mesh" should be downloaded from:

COMMENTS: It should be unzip at the same folder where the main C code is stored. The "Mesh" 
folder contains three sub-folders (damped,sponge,euler) with different binary files used as 
input files by the main code
==============================================================================================
MAIN CODE: main.c

INTERNAL LIBRARIES: "analisis.h", "pstd_opt.h", "gestor_sim.h"

EXTERNAL LIBRARIES: <fftw3.h>, <omp.h>

COMPILATION:g++ -lfftw3 -lfftw3f -fopenmp -O3 *.c -o executable

EXECUTION: ./executable

INPUT: A binary mesh is required and is located ./mallas2/METHOD/3d.outAcc_NUMBER.data 
where METHOD=damped,sponge,euler and NUMBER=1,2,3,4,5,6,7

OUTPUT: 7x3 binary files EnergyAcc_NUMBER_METHOD 
where NUMBER=1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and METHOD:D,S,E

COMMENTS: This code calculates the simulation of a unit impulse signal in a SEG SALT EAGE model 
for each different method (D,S,E) and with the cases of table 2 defined in anhomogeneous cube 
of 4000x4000x4000m and a propagation velocity of c=2000m/s. In all the cases, we also fix the
spatial sampling Dx=40m, the temporal step Dt=0.002s and the total simulation time 4s. For the
Forward simulation, A ricker wavelet of f=10Hz is emitted at the position (Nx/2,Ny/2,4) of the
cube. The output data of each method is recorded at the corresponding . 
The 21x2 simulations are defined varying the tuple (Nabl,Absorbing parameter) according to Table 2 in de paper.

DATA ANALYSIS CODE: energy.m

EXECUTION: octave or matlab R2017b

OUTPUT: Table 4.
